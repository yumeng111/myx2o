GE2/1 GBT1 chip detected

>>>>>>> TEST: READING GBTX SERIAL NUMBER FROM THE TEST FUSES <<<<<<<
PASS: GBTX serial number is not zero: 38308 (test fuse1 = 0xa4, test fuse2 = 0x95)

>>>>>>> TEST: GBTX STATE CHECK <<<<<<<
ERROR: GBTX state is waitXPLLLock, while pauseForConfig state is expected on a blank chip
This can sometimes happen on a blank chip if the chip has not powered up correctly, please power-cycle and try again. If the error continues after multiple power-cycles, set this board aside for investigation.
IMPORTANT: don't forget to disconnect the dongle from the computer before power cycling the OH

>>>>>>> TEST: CHECK IF THE 'UPDATE FROM FUSES' BIT IS SET (EXPECT 0 FOR BLANK CHIP, AND 1 FOR FUSED CHIP) <<<<<<<
PASS: fuse update enable bit is set to 0 as expected

>>>>>>> TEST: GBTX STATE CHECK <<<<<<<
ERROR: GBTX state is waitXPLLLock, while IDLE state is expected on a fused chip
This means that the chip is not locked to the GBT data stream coming from the backend. There can be many causes for that, including bad fiber connection, bad chip configuration, etc..
